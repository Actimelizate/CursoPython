Cambiamos el nombre a todas las columnas Sales para indicar que las unidades estaban en millones y corregir el dataframe Independence 100 cuya columna Sales no representamos en millones para que hubiera consistencia en las tablas.\n","2. Eliminamos algunas columnas adicionales que no vamos a usar en futuros análisis. Seleccionamos \"Content\" y \"Headquarter\" del dataframe top 250 ya que contenían muchos valores NaN y no proporcionaban información útil.\n","3. Agrupamos el dataframe independent 100 por Restaurant para combinar cualquier duplicado dentro de la tabla. Sumamos las columnas \"Sales in Millions\" y \"Meals Served\", calculamos el promedio de la columna \"Average Check\" y hacemos un recuento de cada restaurante para que se pueda ver si estaba representado en la tabla original varias veces. Finalmente, ordenamos este nuevo dataframe por Sales in Millions en orden descendente para ver los nuevos restaurantes mejor clasificados.\n","4. Para mantener la integridad de nuestro dataframe Future 50, hacemos una copia. Nuestro objetivo es fusionar el dataframe con la lista Independent 100 en función de los detalles de la ubicación.\n","5. Usando el dataframe copiado, separamos los valores de \"Location\" en dos columnas separadas (\"City\" y \"State\") y los almacenamos en un nuevo dataframe.\n","6. Para agregar los datos de \"City\" y \"State\" a nuestra copia original del dataframe Future 50, creamos las nuevas columnas y luego insertamos los valores separados en el paso anterior. Finalmente, eliminamos las columnas innecesarias.\n","7. Para mantener la integridad de nuestro dataframe Independent 100, hacemos una copia y luego eliminamos las columnas innecesarias. Hacemos que los dataframes copiados de Future 50 e Independent 100 tengan las mismas columnas para combinarlos fácilmente. Finalmente concatenamos los dos dataframes para hacer una lista del top 150.\n","8. Cogemos el dataframe Top 150 y ordenamos las filas por Sales in Millions. A continuación, reiniciamos el índice y lo hacemos contar desde 1 para mostrar la nueva clasificación. Finalmente, cambiamos el nombre del índice a Rank y eliminamos las columnas innecesarias.\n","\n","##Subida a la base de datos\n","\n","Una vez habiendo hecho un procesado de los datos nos disponemos a hacer los inserts a la BBDD. \n","1.
